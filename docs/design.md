# C2 desktop design system

Status: **0.9.0 candidate**. The visual foundation is structurally frozen; proven business
patterns may still be added through the admission rules below. The system becomes 1.0.0 only after
the preview has been checked on Windows with Segoe UI/Cascadia in light and dark mode.

This document applies to `apps/desktop` only. The website has its own system; only brand and logo
assets may be shared. The machine-readable source is
`apps/desktop/src/design/tokens.css`. Do not copy token values into TypeScript.

Phase 1 established the system, development preview, automated contrast checks, and a no-growth
baseline for existing visual debt. Phase 2 migrates production UI in coherent feature cohorts.
Each cohort lands or reuses the shared pattern first, replaces every selected legacy call site, and
ratchets the baseline down. The baseline is removed only after the final cohort reaches zero.

Open the development-only preview with:

```text
bun run dev:renderer
http://localhost:1420/?design-system=1
```

The preview is not linked from production navigation and is removed from the production bundle by
the `import.meta.env.DEV` gate.

## Design direction

Freeze and strengthen the existing C2 visual language. It is a compact desktop tool, not a
mobile layout and not a showcase for decorative effects.

- One compact density. Content may remain comfortable; chrome stays tight.
- Quiet neutral planes establish hierarchy. C2 blue identifies the primary action.
- Persistent panels, cards, inputs, popovers, and dialogs are borderless and separated by solid
  surface tones plus controlled elevation.
- Hover changes surface or text tone only. It never lifts, scales, or blooms a shadow.
- Icons use Hugeicons and `currentColor`. Provider marks may keep their shape, never their brand color.
- Official themes are light, dark, and system. There is no user accent, provider theme, or custom
  palette.

## Token architecture

There are three levels, in this order:

1. `--ds-foundation-*` stores raw numbers and colors. Product code must never consume it.
2. Semantic roles such as `--ds-color-surface`, `--ds-space-section`, and
   `--ds-type-body-size` describe intent.
3. Shared-component aliases such as `--ds-button-height` and `--ds-dialog-radius` belong only to
   reusable primitives.

Tailwind v4 is the public styling API for product TypeScript. `src/styles.css` maps approved
semantic and shared-component tokens through `@theme inline`; product `.ts`/`.tsx` files consume
the resulting named utilities and never spell `--ds-*` directly. This includes arbitrary-variable
forms such as `rounded-(--ds-radius-control)` and inline styles such as
`var(--ds-color-surface)`. Add a semantic mapping to the theme bridge when a role is missing.

| contract | named Tailwind examples |
| --- | --- |
| surface and content | `bg-canvas`, `bg-surface`, `bg-raised`, `text-content`, `text-content-muted` |
| status and interaction fill | `text-status-success`, `text-status-warning`, `bg-fill-hover` |
| geometry and control size | `rounded-control`, `rounded-module`, `h-control-field`, `h-titlebar`, `h-panel-strip`, `size-icon-control` |
| layer and motion | `shadow-raised`, `shadow-modal`, `duration-feedback`, `ease-enter` |
| interaction focus | `focus-visible:focus-ring` |
| clipped row focus | `focus-visible:focus-ring-inset` |

`Button` owns this choice through `focusStyle="default" | "inset"`; callers do not layer competing focus utilities onto it.

Token and hand-written CSS infrastructure may consume semantic custom properties directly. The
runtime appearance controller and the internal token preview are file-scoped exceptions because
they write or enumerate token names rather than style a product component.

Business components may override layout—width, flex/grid, alignment, positioning, responsive
behavior, and semantic spacing. They may not override typography, color, radius, elevation,
control height, motion, or focus appearance. A missing visual treatment becomes a semantic variant
in the shared primitive, not a local class string.

## System composition

The desktop system has five product-facing parts and one verification layer:

1. **Foundation tokens** are private raw inputs in `src/design/tokens.css`.
2. **Semantic tokens** name color, type, spacing, geometry, elevation, and motion by purpose.
3. **UI primitives** in `src/components/ui` own styling and interaction contracts. Product code
   imports each primitive directly; there is no barrel and no direct Base UI import.
4. **Business components** in `src/components/business` compose primitives into repeated C2
   patterns. They accept semantic content and behavior, not visual escape hatches.
5. **Product surfaces** own domain state, copy, data loading, and feature-specific layout.
6. **Preview, tests, and `check:design`** make the contract visible and prevent new local styling.

`src/main.tsx` loads `styles.css` once for every renderer path; that Tailwind entry imports
`tokens.css`. Feature modules must not import the global token source as a side effect of mounting
a particular screen.

A business component is admitted only when at least two real callers already implement the same
pattern. Its interface must remove visual and accessibility decisions from callers, while domain
state mapping remains in the feature. The change that introduces it also replaces the proven
callers; do not add speculative wrappers or maintain two shared implementations of one pattern.

Transient loading motion uses the shared `Spinner` primitive. It is decorative inside a labelled
button or an existing status region; pass `label` only when the spinner itself owns the status
announcement. Product code must not add `animate-spin` to Lucide icons. Compose `Button` and
`Spinner` for busy actions rather than adding a loading prop to the button. `ActivityOrb` remains
reserved for agent, provider, search, voice, and shaping activity; `LoadFeedback` owns content-
blocking loading and recoverable failures.

Anchored rich content uses the shared `Popover` even when feature state controls whether it is
open. The primitive owns the trigger relationship, portal, focus handling, Escape, and outside-
press dismissal; the feature owns only its domain state, content, anchor, width, and alignment.
External controllers that already own positioning or keyboard selection, such as BlockNote's `@`
menu and the Usage chart hit targets, keep that controller but use the same solid raised surface,
semantic radius, and raised elevation. They do not recreate glass, static borders, decorative
rings, arbitrary radii, or arbitrary shadows.

Product code uses the shared `Textarea` for multiline input. Its default density serves forms and
dialogs; `compact` serves embedded editors and inline comment cards. Feature code owns rows,
placeholders, values, and validation, but not local radius, fill, focus ring, typography, or
padding. Native `<textarea>` belongs only inside the primitive.

Single-line forms use the shared `Input`, `Select`, `Checkbox`, and `Field` primitives. Default
inputs and select triggers are 32px; compact inputs and small select triggers are 28px. Checkbox
visuals remain 16px with an expanded pointer target. `FieldGroup` owns the 16px form-section gap,
while `Field` owns label, description, invalid, and error relationships. Every `SelectItem` is
composed inside `SelectGroup`; product surfaces do not place items directly in `SelectContent`.
`Command` uses a 32px search field and 28px menu rows. The development preview renders these real
shared components rather than maintaining CSS lookalikes.

Viewport-bound dialogs use `max-h-dialog-max`; their bounded file, issue, and preview collections
use `max-h-dialog-content`. Both resolve through the Tailwind theme bridge, so product code does not
repeat viewport calculations or read shared-component variables directly. Scrollable rows use the
shared `ScrollArea` and an inset-focus `Button` row; the primitive owns radius, focus, and scrollbar
visuals while the feature keeps its result content and keyboard-selection state.

Structural divisions use the shared `Separator` rather than local `border-b`, `border-t`, or
inline-edge border utilities. The separator is semantic when it divides content; use
`aria-hidden` only when an adjacent resize handle already owns the separator role. Table, diff,
code, document, and native scrollbar structure remain file-scoped content exceptions.

The shared business set is:

| module | owns | current callers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PageHeader` | page heading hierarchy, description measure, responsive action placement | Automations, Plugin Hub, Scene Studio, Task Board |
| `SearchField` | labelled search input, icon geometry, optional accessible clear action | Automations, Plugin Hub, Task Board, Pull Requests, Plugin Manager, Memory, Trajectory |
| `Empty` primitive | empty-state hierarchy, media, description, and action composition | Automations, Plugin Hub, Pull Requests |
| `SelectableRow` | compact picker choice, visible selection mark, accessible selected/disabled state, description and metadata layout | Composer mode, memory, collaboration, worktree, provider, and model pickers; Scene picker; Checkout picker |
| `StatusBadge` | neutral, success, warning, and destructive status-pill treatment | Automations, Turn Card, Plugin Manager and bundle administration, Scene chip/popover, GitHub pull-request detail |
| `SettingToggle` | visible label and description association, immediate boolean control, disabled presentation, and row layout | Project actions, Memory, Sync, Project scheduling, Appshots, Pets |

`SelectableRow` is deliberately limited to persistent selection inside compact pickers. Radio or
checkbox questions, navigation/current-page rows, disclosure rows, and master-detail list rows keep
their own interaction contracts. `StatusBadge` is limited to labelled pills; dot-and-label status
indicators and metadata such as source, version, or category are not variants of it. Domain values
such as `failed`, `paused`, or `trusted` are mapped to its small semantic tone set inside the owning
feature rather than taught to the shared component. `SettingToggle` is limited to immediately
applied boolean preferences. Form selections, batch selection, tri-state policy, and composite rows
with disclosure or secondary actions retain their checkbox, select, or feature-owned contracts.

## Color and surfaces

All app chrome consumes semantic OKLCH tokens. The five neutral planes are fixed:

| role | use |
| --- | --- |
| `canvas` | window content background |
| `sidebar` | application chrome; macOS may use native vibrancy |
| `surface` | cards, fields, persistent panels |
| `raised` | menus, popovers, tooltips |
| `modal` | dialogs and blocking surfaces |

Components cannot mix transparency to invent a sixth plane. macOS sidebar vibrancy is the only
native-material exception; Windows uses a solid sidebar. Cards, inputs, popovers, and dialogs are
always solid. Reduced Transparency forces the macOS sidebar to its solid token.

C2 blue is fixed for primary actions. Use no more than one primary action per local area.
Success, warning, destructive, and neutral keyboard focus have dedicated roles. A color change must
be made centrally, pass the light and dark contrast contracts, and land in an isolated visual-token
commit with light, dark, and narrow screenshots.

Dark mode separates planes with lightness and tighter dark shadows. Do not add a white hairline,
inner glow, or translucent glass to recover separation.

## Typography

Use the platform UI stack:

```css
-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", sans-serif
```

Monospace uses `ui-monospace`, SF Mono on macOS, and Cascadia/Consolas fallbacks on Windows. Do not
bundle Inter or force SF on Windows.

| role | size / line height | use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Large title | 26 / 32 | rare top-level statement |
| Page title | 22 / 26 | full-page title |
| Section | 17 / 22 | section heading |
| Dialog | 15 / 20 | dialog and panel title |
| Body / control | 13 / 16 | rows, buttons, menus, single-line body |
| Callout | 12 / 15 | secondary descriptions and tab labels |
| Metadata | 11 / 14 | timestamps, paths, hints |
| Caption / keycap | 10 / 13 | badges and compact keyboard labels |

Transcript, Markdown, and document content use 13 / 20 for multi-line body text. Code blocks use
12 / 18. Content headings may use 15, 17, and 22; compact density applies to surrounding chrome,
not to reading comfort.

Tailwind's `text-xs`, `text-sm`, `text-base`, and arbitrary `text-[…]` values are not part of the
system.

## Spacing, geometry, and control height

Spacing is a 4px grid with one controlled 2px optical step:

| value | semantic role |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | optical correction |
| 4 | inline and metadata gap |
| 6 | icon/text and grouped controls |
| 8 | row horizontal inset and module gap |
| 12 | card, popover, and persistent-panel inset |
| 16 | section and form group |
| 24 | dialog and page gutter |
| 32 | large page section |

The visible semantic radius floor is 12px:

- 12: checkbox, status mark, micro element, button, input, menu item, and list row.
- 16: card, popover, sidebar module, dialog, and large panel.
- 24: Composer, whose larger content surface keeps its own fixed semantic radius.

Fully round geometry is reserved for intrinsically circular objects. Icons are exactly 12 / 14 /
16px for inline, list, and control roles. Standard UI does not use 20px icons.

Control heights are 24px for mini/icon/inline controls, 28px for normal buttons, menus, and
toolbars, and 32px for inputs, selects, and important controls. A taller element is content input
such as Composer, not a generic large-button size.

Session titlebar tools form one quiet monochrome toolbar. Icons and labels keep the muted foreground
across rest, hover, open, and pressed states; hover may add a neutral surface and keyboard focus
adds the standard ring. A real open or pressed state may use only a neutral fill. Titlebar actions
never switch to the product accent color. Independent 28px controls use a 4px gap; joined
split-button halves keep a zero-width inner gap and a subtle seam.

The session titlebar divider is contextual: an empty pane has no bottom hairline, while a pane with
persisted, running, or loading conversation content restores the semantic border. Rail and dock
titlebars keep their structural separators.

## Elevation and borders

Elevation communicates a real layer and never changes on hover:

| role | use |
| --- | --- |
| `elevation-surface` | input, card, persistent panel |
| `elevation-raised` | menu, popover, tooltip |
| `elevation-modal` | dialog, blocking overlay |

Settings pages separate major groups with page-section spacing. Related rows share one tonal module
with internal hairlines; they do not become a stack of individually elevated cards. Choice tiles
such as appearance schemes and themes use tonal hover and a semantic selected ring without surface
elevation. Input fields, popovers, and dialogs retain the elevation assigned to their real layer.

Static borders and decorative rings are forbidden. The complete whitelist is:

- neutral keyboard focus;
- error or warning status;
- table, diff, code, or document content structure;
- resize divider or drag target;
- progress track.

## State contracts

Every shared control implements rest, hover, keyboard focus, disabled, and loading. Selected and
invalid are added where meaningful.

- **Focus:** a 2px neutral, high-contrast indicator, visible for keyboard focus only. No blue
  focus ring. Inputs may slightly raise their surface, but must not resize.
- **Invalid:** a persistent 2px destructive indicator plus adjacent error text.
- **Disabled:** 50% opacity and no pointer events; do not invent a disabled gray.
- **Read-only:** quiet fill and normal legibility.
- **Loading:** stable dimensions with a 14px spinner; do not swap to a differently sized control.

Button variants are Primary, Secondary, Ghost, and Destructive. Secondary is a neutral elevated
surface, Ghost has no shadow, and Destructive is red only for a destructive action. Outline is not
a variant. Default buttons are 28px, mini and icon buttons are 24px, and the 32px field size is
reserved for an action that must align with an input or select. Size changes never introduce a
different radius.

Tabs provide three presentations without changing their keyboard or panel contract: Default is a
32px segmented container with 28px triggers, Line is content navigation with a 2px selection mark,
and Toolbar is a 28px application strip. Tabs use `rounded-control`, semantic fills, and the shared
focus ring; callers may control width, overflow, and orientation only.

Dialog and Alert Dialog share `bg-overlay`, `bg-modal`, `rounded-modal`, `shadow-modal`, a 24px
gutter, and the same header/footer typography and spacing. Callers may choose a semantic maximum
width or scrolling behavior, but do not rebuild the overlay, radius, elevation, or close control.

Card owns the solid `surface` plane, 16px radius, surface elevation, 12px inset, title,
description, content, and footer hierarchy. Product callers compose those parts and may change
layout, but do not restate the card fill, radius, elevation, typography, or inset.

Popover, Tooltip, and Toast share the solid `raised` plane and raised elevation without a
decorative border or translucent glass. Popover uses the 16px module radius and 12px inset;
Tooltip uses the 12px control radius and waits 600ms before the first open, with a 400ms instant
phase between related triggers. Toast uses shared Buttons for actions, announces errors as alerts,
and announces other outcomes as status messages. Callers own content, anchoring, and layout only.

Inputs use a neutral surface plus `elevation-surface`, without a border. Rest, hover, keyboard
focus, invalid, disabled, read-only, and loading all preserve the 32px field contract.

## Motion

| role | duration | use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| feedback | 120ms | hover, press, color, opacity |
| layer | 160ms | menu, popover, tooltip |
| dialog | 220ms | dialog, dock, tree |
| page | 280ms | full-page transition |

Entrances use `cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)` and exits use `ease-in`. Do not add spring, bounce,
hover scaling, or a one-off duration. Reduced Motion collapses all four semantic durations.

## Window behavior

The desktop minimum remains 800×500. Window classes are compact at 800–999px, standard at
1000–1399px, and wide at 1400px and above. Local modules use container queries when their own
available width—not the window—is the cause of a layout change. There is no mobile application
layout. Dialogs must avoid overflow around 400px for tests and auxiliary windows.

## Shared components and exceptions

Local shadcn/ui components remain the unique styled foundation. Interaction primitives use Base
UI behind `components/ui`; product surfaces use the Base `render` composition API and must not
import primitive libraries directly. Radix-backed wrappers and the direct `radix-ui` dependency
are not part of the desktop UI contract.

AI-native presentation patterns may use selected AI Elements source components under
`components/ai-elements`. Adapt them to C2 tokens and ACP data rather than adding Next.js or
AI SDK transport assumptions. Do not reimplement conversations, messages, reasoning, tools,
plans, or task progress inside product surfaces when an AI Element fits the behavior.

Terminal, Monaco/Shiki, and BlockNote are controlled content-renderer exceptions:

- their surrounding chrome uses C2 semantic tokens;
- xterm may use its fixed ANSI palette;
- Monaco/Shiki may own syntax colors and editor content typography;
- BlockNote may own document typography inside the document surface.

Every exception is file-scoped with a reason in `scripts/design-system-allowlist.json`.

## Accessibility

Version 1 includes Reduced Motion, Reduced Transparency, Increased Contrast, and Bold Text. Bold
Text is represented by `data-ds-bold-text` until Phase 2 wires the native desktop preference. There
is no independent UI zoom in v1; the product retains one compact density. Semantic colors are
checked in both schemes by `bun run check:design`.

## Behavioral laws retained from C2

- Live transcript follows the bottom only while the reader is already at the latest content.
  Pointer or keyboard interaction pauses following and exposes “Jump to latest.” Prepending history
  preserves the content under the reader.
- Actions provide perceptible feedback. Use the shared toast for outcomes, prefer undo for
  recoverable actions, and reserve confirmation dialogs for irreversible work.
- Tooltips explain unlabelled icons; they never contain information required to proceed.
- Errors remain visible long enough to read and act on.

## Enforcement and migration

Run from `apps/desktop`:

```bash
bun run check:design
bun test
bun run build
```

The checker reads CSS tokens directly, verifies declared contrast pairs, and scans product CSS,
JavaScript, TypeScript, and TSX for raw color, arbitrary values, off-scale type and Tailwind
spacing, radii, shadow, motion, borders, direct design-token or foundation-token use, visual
`!important`, and non-contract control heights. Errors include file, line, matched value, and the
expected replacement. Renderer builds also inspect compiled CSS for representative semantic
selectors and unresolved Tailwind token rules. Physical and logical spacing directions share the
same scale; arbitrary border/ring values and pointer-focus rings are debt. The scanner admits only
the exact 2px keyboard-focus and invalid-state forms defined by the state contract.

`scripts/design-system-baseline.json` records the remaining accepted debt by rule, path, value,
and source-context occurrence. CI allows debt to decrease but rejects both count growth and moving
an accepted value into new code. New system files have zero baseline allowance. Each Phase 2
cohort removes the fingerprints it owns; the final cohort deletes the empty baseline.

Pixel-diff CI is intentionally deferred because platform system-font rasterization differs. CI
enforces rules and contrast; the development preview is manually checked in light, dark, narrow,
Reduced Motion, Increased Contrast, and Bold Text. After the migration, evaluate separate macOS
and Windows visual baselines.

## Versioning and review

- Patch: documentation or alias correction with no semantic/visual change.
- Minor: token value change or additive semantic role.
- Major: token removal, rename, or meaning change.

Foundation changes belong in an isolated commit and require light, dark, and narrow screenshots.
A feature PR cannot casually change foundation values. Before 1.0.0, validate the Preview on
Windows in Segoe UI/Cascadia, light and dark; until then the status remains 0.9.x.
